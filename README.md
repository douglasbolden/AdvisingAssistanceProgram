# AdvisingAssistanceProgram
Lets advisors see a list of classes in lowest to highest order, and allows advisor to see course information of each course.

* Program starts:
  * Displays menu:
    * 1: Load Data Structure
    * 2: Print Course List
    * 3: Print Course
    * 9: Exit
      * (switch)
        * 1: Load the vector with our items that are located in our '.txt' file.
        * 2: Sorts and then prints all courses that are currently in the vector.
        * 3: Displays all information in the vector about the specified course.
        * 9: Exits the System
    

***What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?***

I was creating a program that will sort courses that are given to the input from lowest to highest, andthat allowed the user to see information about the courses.

***How did you approach the problem?***

I chose the data structure that used the least amount of memory. It came down between a vector and a hash table. Vectors are easier to work with, and their memory allocation is contiguous. In my opinion, the better option is to use a vector.

***How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?***

To overcome roadblocks, I left my computer to refresh myself. I usually walked on the treadmill, or I would go out to the store to get my mind off of it and allow myself to have a fresh, new perspective when I returned.

***How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?***

I got to learn the basics of BigO Notation, and I learned more about vectors, hashes, and binary search trees. This brought me to a few other concepts, and I tried to ingest as much information as I could.

***How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?***

This project has allowed me to understand that not everything is the way it seems. I could not make a CSV work for this. I think it may be that I don't know the correct way to set a CSV up, but it would not work. Always threw an error about NULL pointers, but the area that was supposedly NULL, would have something in the location. This very well could have been my fault... ANYWAY:
While working on this, I learned a valuable lesson that should be taught to other programmers. Reusing code is great. It can be devastating though. It might even make you have to rethink everything about your program. I eventually made my own parser. I made it using the <fstream> and the <sstream> libraries.
  
Thank you for reading!
